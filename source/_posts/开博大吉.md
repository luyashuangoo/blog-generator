Let me not to the marriage of true mindsAdmit impediments. 
Love is not loveWhich alters when it alteration finds,Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! it is an ever-fixed markThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,Whose worth's unknown, 
although his highth be takenLove's not Time's fool, 
though rosy lips and cheeksWithin his bending sickle's compass come:
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
